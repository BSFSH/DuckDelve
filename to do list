## Note to self - I need to update app.py or probably add a second function somewhere else to pull data from the google sheet into the local .csv only once per week. Scheduled job
## Also, give it a button so I can update it at will.

### Current steps:
Update the index.html to look like the mock up
    -add toggle buttons
    - build Sets area
