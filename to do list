## Note to self - I need to update app.py or probably add a second function somewhere else to pull data from the google sheet into the local .csv only once per week. Scheduled job
## Also, give it a button so I can update it at will.

### Current steps:
display any "locked in" items underneath Current # of Sets
improve the filtering and displaying of data under 'available spells' to eventually
Optimize the process to reduce calculation or "waiting" time
Display a "thinking" whirlygig somewhere?
